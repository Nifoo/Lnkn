# Lnkn - a Linkedin Users Profile Search Engine in Django/Elasticsearch
- The data in Elasticsearch come from a crawler, you can build your own database according to the specific seed user you start from. See the crawler project of mine: https://github.com/Nifoo/CrawlerScrapy
- Implemented the search bar with dynamic suggestion list and the search results with keywords highlighting by using AJAX and Elasticsearch query.
- Each search result links to the user's Linkedin page. So you can visit their homepage by one click.
- Some screenshots:
